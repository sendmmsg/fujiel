Component for esphome to get a Fuji Electric heatpump (RSG-09 / ROG-09) to work.
Uses the AR-REB1E remote control which I couldn't get working without resorting to hacking a component 
using the 'IRremoteESP8266' library.

Includes example (`living.yaml`) for my setup with a BME280/ENS160 combo attached to I2C and an IR-LED driver connected to GPIO pin.
